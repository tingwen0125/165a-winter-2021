"""
A data strucutre holding indices for various columns of a table. 
Key column should be indexd by default, other columns can be indexed through this object.
Indices are usually B-Trees, but other data structures can be used as well.

The Index class provides a data structure that allows fast processing of queries (e.g.,
select or update) by indexing columns of tables over their values. Given a certain
value for a column, the index should efficiently locate all records having that value. The
key column of all tables is usually indexed by default for performance reasons.
Supporting indexing is optional for this milestone. The API for this class exposes the
two functions create_index and drop_index (optional for this milestone).
